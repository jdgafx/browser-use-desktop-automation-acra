## ‚ú® New Enhanced Features

### üí¨ Interactive Prompting During Execution
- **Real-time user interaction**: The automation can pause and ask for your input during execution
- **Dynamic direction changes**: Alter the automation flow based on what you see happening
- **Smart decision points**: The AI will ask for guidance when it encounters ambiguous situations
- **Timeout protection**: Prompts automatically timeout after 5 minutes to prevent hanging

**Example Usage:**
```
Command: "Apply to software engineer jobs on LinkedIn"
